# DayZ-Extract-Class-Names
A simple python script that helps you out when working with a mod. It will pull all the neccesary names and then it will place them in a list in a txt file. This helps a lot if you are dealing with a lot of items and you require a list for the types.xml file for example

For now it does a check that the class names have HMB_ at the start of the string because the mod i'm working on has this but feel free to change it to whatever you like. Hope this helps
